# Ruby enumerable method implementations

The solo project to test my understanding of the Enumerable methods in Ruby.
Especially, I implemented methods for "each, each_with_index, select, all?, any?, none? count, map, inject".

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
